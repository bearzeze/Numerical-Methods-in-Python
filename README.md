# **Numerical Methods With Python**

## Basic and most used numerical methods coded in Python 3.11

Numerical methods and code are divided in sections with numerous most popular methods for each section. Also there are Python built-in methods shown as well for each section:

1. **Finding Roots of High-Degree Equations**
2. **Interpolation and Approximation**
3. **Differentiation**
4. **Integration**
5. **Systems of Linear Equations**
6. **Ordinary Differential Equations**

## **How To Use Code**
Fork and download if you and as you like.

### **Section 1 - Roots of High Degree Equations**
There are code for the known algorithms of finding the roots of the high-degree equations:
* Simple Iteration method
* Newton-Raphson method
* Bisection method
* False Position (Regula Falsi) method
* Secant method

There are also Python built-in methods from the SciPy module:

* root()
* fsolve
* bisect()
* newton

You will need first to install scipy module:

`pip install scipy`

And afterwards import methods in the .py file:

`from scipy import root, fsolve, bisect, newton`



## **Needs To Be Done**
- Systems of Non-Linear Equations
- Systems of Ordinary Differential Equations
